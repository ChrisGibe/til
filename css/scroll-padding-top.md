# Break out the container

Sometimes, you need to add on "link Anchor" inside your page with an href who points on this link.
And when you click on your link to go on this anchor, your window don't stop exactly on the top of your element.
It's because you have definitely a nav bar in absolute position who is ignore by your window when you use your href to go on your anchor.
The solution is to give a 'scroll-padding-top' to your htlm for avoid this.

```

// If your navbar have 4rem of height
html {
  scroll-padding-top: 4rem;
}

```
